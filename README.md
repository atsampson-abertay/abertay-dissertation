# LaTeX class for Abertay University dissertations

Adam Sampson <a.sampson@abertay.ac.uk>

This is a (draft!) LaTeX style that implements Abertay's style
guidelines for honours dissertations.

## TODO

* How to use this repository -- e.g. as a submodule
* Using multiple files
* What packages are required (all in TeXLive)
* Word counting
* Better bibliography style (see Jiri's: https://github.com/deltodon/biblatex-harvard)
* COPYING file (LPPL)
